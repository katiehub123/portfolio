               <p>Animal testing are still mandatory in some countries. Everything from your toothpaste to your washing detergent has been forcefully tested on animals. This is still a big problem, because animals are permanently damaged. Some animals are reused for multiple tests. There's nothing "humane" about forcefully injecting deadly chemicals into animals. They have the right to live just as much as we do. </p>
               <p>HSI are working with many countries to find an alternative solution to animal testing. Until now, we’ve found many methods that are more effective and accurate compare to the traditional ways. We provide training in developing countries to help companies and government authorities transitioning to modern non-animal methods.</p>
